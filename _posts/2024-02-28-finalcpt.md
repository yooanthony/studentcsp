Summary of Final CPT Project
----------------------

Our group worked on a travel website with different games like trivia, a quiz to find out where you should travel to, and a memory game and guessing game with flags. There was a leaderboard with scores tracked based on users from the signups.

My Feature
----------

I worked on the frontend and coded my game which was a travel guessing quiz. I tried to connect the backend with the frontend in my quiz by trying to fetch 5 cities/national parks/tropical places based on the result of the quiz, along with the language, timezone, and weather of each. However, I had trouble getting that to work so my feature was just the travel quiz.
