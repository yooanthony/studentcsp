Q5: An "or" logic gate should have a true and false input, and I put false for both.

Q16: index should be decremented after each element is checked

Q35: The OverMax procedure compares each element of a list to a given threshold, but it does not generalize the functionality of MaxTwo and MaxThree to calculate the maximum of any number of values, which would be Max.

Q38: IPv6 allows for a greater number of addresses than IPv4, which allows more devices to be connected to the Internet

Q50: An algorithm accesses just 10 elements, is considered reasonable time.

Q56: version II calls GetPrediction twice for each element of idList (plus one more time at the end). Therefore, version II takes longer than version I.

57/67 I didn't do corrections for a couple simple messups. However, overall, I think I did well on those questions that were less technical and involved more real-world problems. Some of the basic coding concepts were easy too, but there were also some difficult questions in coding or more technical questions that I struggled on.
