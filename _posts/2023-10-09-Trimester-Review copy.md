Some of the things that really helped me learn were the team teaches, as all of the collegeboard content about coding which I had minimal understanding of became more familiar to me as I was taught through the different hacks and homeworks I completed.

One thing I would like to work on was my focus on this class, as after the trimester started and I did well, I began to prioritize other things and lost focus on this class.

I also learned how long it takes to code something original, whether it be with your team or individually, as we spent a lot of time at the 4s library and at my house, not even coding but brainstorming for a lot of the time. Not all questions can be answered by ChatGPT if they are original ideas, because the internet may not understand the specificity of your idea or question.
