Question 14: Developing Algorithms
-the line of code said "display i" so I thought they both displayed the same values, but that was just one part of a larger block of code that showed a list, which were different values

Question 21: Comparing Robot Algorithms
-the starting square that the robot is on does not count as travelling a square, so i picked go forward 3 instead of go forward 2

Question 23: Redundant Routing with four computers
-Redundant routing is not possible witih only one path, so the question was asking for the impossible path which is the one with one path

Question 33: Apartment rental Web site flowchart
-This flowchart shows 2 possible endings, so the block of code equivalent to it would use the word "or" not "and"

Question 55: Results of the KeepPlaying Procedure
-The code has a problem with having the intended result, because it wants the response "y" or "yes" to return true, but since it uses the word "and", it makes it so it could never return true since one response cannot be "y" and "yes" at the same time

Overall: One of the important things I learned was the difference between "or" and "and" in code, and the significance of looking at the entire block of code working together and not just trying to assume the result of the function by looking at one line of code.
