-Iteration: looping of data in algorithm
-started with background info of flow of information and control statements
-explanation of break function (stops at value where break is), continue function (skips value whereever placed), range function (prints up to one less than the range)

Things we did well:
-used candy to encourage people to have original ideas, instead of just completing the hack in a basic way
-divided up the speaking to make sure each group member presented what they contributed and were comfortable with

Things to improve
-pacing of the presentation, had to speed it up at the end
-worked on the team teach separately, not all on same page so some things were repeated in the lesson
