> Update Blog to contain all hacks.
- [X]  - Galaga gave us many issues including the fact that it would crash and end game after killing each and every enemy. There was also an entity crash wich was fixed by making everything shoot once. To add a dificulty interval, all you do is simply increase the amount of enemy per seccond. It spawns randomly on screen.
- [X] Linux code worked that and added syntax on the command line.
- [X] created the Javascript api table. this table fetches an api from the web and then it displays data in pages using jquerry. This is then styled with css. We ran into many errors on this project as css sometimes did not load, to fix this problem, we added a table from the start rather then generation of new tags.
